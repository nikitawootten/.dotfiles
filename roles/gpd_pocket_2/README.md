# GPD Pocket 2 Ansible Role

This role contains a collection of tweaks to make my GPD Pocket 2 nicer to use!

Tweaks include:
- Changing the DPI using an `Xresources` file
- Rebinding the weird kanji key using `Xmodmap`
- Setting up `touchegg` (touch gesture daemon), enabling touchscreen support in `firefox`
- Rotating the screen, and setting the touchscreen bounds
